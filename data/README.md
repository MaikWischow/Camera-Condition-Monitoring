## Data
The [data](data) directory contains exemplary (monochromed) images of the employed datasets [Sim](data/sim), [KITTI](data/kitti) and [Udacity](data/udacity) to test the code. 
There is also a [kernels](data/kernels) sub-directory with the defocus blur and motion blur kernels used in our experiments. The kernels are given as images and as sampled MTF values.
The [Udacity](data/udacity) sub-directory also contains some test results for object detection, blur estimation and noise estimation.
