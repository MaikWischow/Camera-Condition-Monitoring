# Data
This directory contains exemplary (monochromed) images of the employed datasets [Sim](./sim), [KITTI](./kitti) and [Udacity](./udacity) to test our source code. 
The [Udacity](./udacity) sub-directory further contains some test results for object detection, blur estimation and noise estimation.
There is also a [kernels](./kernels) sub-directory with the defocus blur and motion blur kernels used in our experiments. The kernels are given as images and as sampled MTFs.
