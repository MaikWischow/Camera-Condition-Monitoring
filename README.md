## General information
- Each sub-directory contains its own readMe file with instructions.
- All python scripts that are intended to be executable have a commented out example code at the end. Before you run any scripts, please uncomment and customize the respective code blocks first. Matlab scripts can be customized and executed directly.
- All python package requirements are specified in the tested versions. Attention: The tensorflow packages of the blur estimation and the noise estimation CNNs are not compatible with each other! Please consider two separate package environments for both.
