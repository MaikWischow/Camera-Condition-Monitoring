# Monitoring and Adapting the Physical State of a Camera for Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains the source code of the paper:
Wischow, M., Gallego, G., Ernst, I., BÃ¶rner, A., (2023). Monitoring and Adapting the Physical State of a Camera for Autonomous Vehicles.

We propose a modular and general self-health-maintenance framework that strives for optimal application performance. 
We demonstrate the working principle of the framework on the exemplary application of object detection, and focus on motion blur and noise as typical undesired disturbances (see Fig. 1).
